# Estimation-lag-time-monomer-addition
Matlab code for kinetic model of paper "Estimation of the lag time in a subsequent monomer addition model for fibril elongation" [Phys.Chem.Chem.Phys. 18 (2016), 21259]. Computer code for model simulations was developed by Suzanne K. Shoffner. If you use this code, please cite our paper. For more details, please visit: https://doi.org/10.1039/c5cp07845h
